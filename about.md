If you want:
-a quiet place to host a small gathering or retreat? 
-a fiber internet-connected but otherwise unplugged location for monthlong sabbatical? 
-an “internship” for your kids to do farm work 
-a place for a vacation home with like-minded friends living nearby? 
-a place to live on several acres with same?

We have:
-a working fruit farm with 400+acres of forest land 
-three lakefront houses (currently occupied) and two rustic cabins (currently unoccupied) on premise 
-(currently building an additional house 2 miles off-premise, estimated ready by Sept 2022)
-ability to host a weeklong gathering of up to 20 people in one house 
-85 years of family history in the area (fishing knowledge, hunting knowledge, who to hire and where to live knowledge) 
-many amenities for teambuliding or for quality life (on prem: garden, lightning talks, squat rack, ceramics studio, hot tub, swimming, 4 canoes, windboard, catamaran, fishing boat, rifle ranges, ski and hiking trails, poetry nights and game nights) 
-wonderful people 
-very permissive zoning 

Cost:
While I’m fleshing out the rental process, budget:
$15/person/day to cover food, lodging, and utilities for a summit gathering, 
or $200/month for a sabbatical cabin (food not included unless negotiated). 
I reserve the right to update these prices as I learn more. 

Location: 
2.5 hours from MSP airport; 
15 minutes from fleet farm outfitter, full grocery store, walmart, farmers’ market, hospital; 
6 minutes from staples grocery store, coffeeshop; 
17 minutes to mountain bike trails and cross country ski trails.

What’s in it for me? 
Because of my involvement in a geographically limited industry, and because of already having deep capital investments in the farm founded by my grandfather, this swamp is my settling place. But I love the culture, conversations, and friendships afforded by Boston, SF, Austin, NYC, Reno, and don’t want to be cut off from these communities because of my rurality. So, if you’re looking for a place for quiet retreats, choose mine! Because I’m invested in continuing face to face friendships even after “moving back home,” I want to provide the amenities to make vacations easy and fun. 

That said, I’m a private person by nature and not on twitter, so I appreciate friends sharing this with friends! With a bit of elbow grease, I hope for my swamp to become a schelling point, whether for weekends, sabbaticals, vacations, internships, or homestead development.
