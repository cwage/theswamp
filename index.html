  <h1>Why am I doing this?</h1>
<p>Because of my involvement in a geographically limited industry, and because of already having deep capital investments in the farm founded by my grandfather, this swamp is my settling place. But I love the culture, conversations, and friendships afforded by Boston, SF, Austin, NYC, Reno, and don’t want to be cut off from these communities because of my rurality. So, if you’re looking for a place for quiet retreats, choose mine! Because I’m invested in continuing face to face friendships even after “moving back home,” I want to provide the amenities to make vacations easy and fun.

That said, I’m a private person by nature and not on twitter, so I appreciate friends sharing this with friends! With a bit of elbow grease, I hope for my swamp to become a schelling point, whether for weekends, sabbaticals, vacations, internships, or homestead development.</p>
