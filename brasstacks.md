# Transportation Options:
Nearest International Airports: MSP (2.5 hr), MSN (5 hr)  
For transportation between MSP and The Swamp, in addition to standard rental car or carpool options, [NWT Express Shuttle](https://nwtexpressshuttle.com/) is reliable at $85/person.  
Nearest Regional Airports: KHYR (20m), DLH (60m), EAU (95m)  

# Cost to rent on-premise:
While I'm fleshing out the rental process, budget:   
$15/person/day to cover food, lodging, and utilities for a summit gathering,   
or $200/month for a sabbatical cabin (food not included unless negotiated).   
I reserve the right to update these prices as I learn more. I am aiming for break-even.
